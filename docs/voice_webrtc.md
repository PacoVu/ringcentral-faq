# Voice - WebRTC FAQ

### Are WebRTC call events captured via the event system?

Yes. Voice calls via WebRTC, RingOut and RingCentral endpoints are all captured via the event system. To check the presence status of an extension, you can call the extension presence API endpoint or subscribe to presence events via the subscription API or webhoks API.
